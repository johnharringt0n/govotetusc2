# Issue 1: Redistricting

### What Is It?

Issue 1 comes on the ballot on **May 8th, 2018** and is the most important and immediate goal we have at GoVoteTusc.

This issue is what's called a Legislatively Referred Constitutional Amendment (LRCA) and it creates a procedure for congressional redistricting.

### Why Do We Need Redistricting?
The current district lines are based off of the 2010 census which does not reflect the current citizens of Tuscarawas County. These lines also suffer from **gerrymandering** which is the drawing of political lines for the benefit of one party over another.
