# Who Are We?

After a year of nonsense, we decided that it wasn't enough to just sit back and complain about what was happening around us. As a group of similarly minded folks, we decided that there had to be a way to change what was happening around us politically and culturally. We decided that one of the ways that can have the most impact on the local, state and national level is to get voters educated, involved and to the polls. Together we can make a difference.

# What's Our Goal?

Increase voter turnout in the 2018 midterm elections and encourage Tuscarawas County citizens to Get Out The Vote!
