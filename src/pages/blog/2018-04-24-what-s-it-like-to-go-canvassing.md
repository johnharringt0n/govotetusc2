Talking to voters is one of the most important activities you can do to help influence elections, particularly for midterm races where turnout is traditionally very low. 

[Studies](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6282/220) have shown that conversations with voters and getting them to “commit” in advance can have a big impact on election day...so, how do we make that actionable? Enter “canvassing.”

# What Is It?

Webster’s defines canvassing as :

> 1: To toss in a canvas sheet in sport or punishment
>
> 2: To examine in detail, specifically to examine (votes) officially for authenticity
>
> 3: to go through (a district) or go to (persons) in order to solicit orders or political support or to determine opinions or sentiments canvass voters canvassed the neighborhood to solicit magazine subscriptions

Which is a long-winded way of saying that vote canvassing is as simple as getting a group of people together and talking to citizens in your neighborhood about the issues on the upcoming ballot (and we can guarantee our canvassing involves no sheet tossing despite what Webster’s might think).

# Canvassing With GoVoteTusc

Here at GoVoteTusc, we’ve had several canvassing events so far where we’ve gone door to door to remind Tuscarawas County voters that there is a primary election happening on May 8th, 2018. We help provide voters with information about the ballot measures as well as details on where and when they can vote.

We’ll typically spend 1 - 2 hours in small groups making sure we cover the full area we’ve selected on the map.

# Get Out There and Have Fun!

Canvassing isn’t just about collecting pledge cards, it’s about getting out there and connecting with voters in your community and other GoVoteTusc volunteers.



Talking with voters in your neighborhood is a great way to get politically active and have a positive impact on your community.



So have a great time out there and check out our [Events](/events) page for a list of upcoming canvassing events to join. We hope to see you there!
